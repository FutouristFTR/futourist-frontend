            <h4> Definitions </h4>
            <p>
              The data protection declaration of [YOUR COMPANY] is based on the terms used by the
              European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
              Our protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general
              public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like
              to begin by explaining the terminology used.
            </p>
            <p>
              (“Personal data” or “Personal Information”) means any information relating to an
              identified or identifiable natural person (“Data subject”). An identifiable natural
              person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
              reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an
              online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
              genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
            </p>
            <p>
              (“Processing”) is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal
              data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as
              collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
              retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
              making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of
              limiting their processing in the future. (“Profiling”) means any form of automated
              processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain
              personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict
              aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation,
              health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
              movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              (“Pseudonymisation”) is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the
              personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use
              of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept
              separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the
              personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
            </p>
            <p>
              (“Controller”) responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public
              authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the
              purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of
              such processing are determined by Union law, the controller or the specific criteria
              for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
            </p>
            <p>
              (“Processor”) is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body
              which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. (“Recipient”) is a natural
              or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data
              are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may
              receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with
              Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those
              data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data
              protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              (“Third party”) is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other
              than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct
              authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
              Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous
              indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a
              clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data
              relating to him or her.

              the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a
              structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right
              to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to
              which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on
              consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2)
              of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and
              the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not
              necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the
              exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Furthermore, in exercising
              his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data
              subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one
              controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely
              affect the rights and freedoms of others. In order to assert the right to data
              portability, the data subject may at any time contact the Data Protection Officer
              designated by [YOUR COMPANY] d.o.o. or another employee. [YOUR COMPANY] d.o.o. is part
              of [YOUR COMPANY] that operates internationally. All data we process is stored in the

              legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any
              time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point
              (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these
              provisions. [YOUR COMPANY] shall no longer process the personal data in the event of
              the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
              processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or
              for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. If [YOUR COMPANY]
              processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the
              right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for
              such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such
              direct marketing. If the data subject objects to [YOUR COMPANY] to the processing for
              direct marketing purposes, [YOUR COMPANY] will no longer process the personal data for
              these purposes. In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to
              his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning
              him or her by [YOUR COMPANY] for scientific or historical research purposes, or for
              statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is
              necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest. In
              order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact the Data
              Protection Officer of [YOUR COMPANY] or another employee. In addition, the data
              subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and
              notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated
              means using technical specifications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Automated individual decision-making, including profiling Each data subject shall have
              the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based
              solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects
              concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the
              decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract
              between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union law
              to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to
              safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is

            <p>
              Traffic information is erased or made anonymous when it’s no longer needed for the

              period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment pursued.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beside traffic information mentioned above, we may collect two types of information:
              “personal information” and “aggregate information”.

            <h4>Legal basis for processing</h4>
            <p>
              Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we
              obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data
              is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as
              is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of
              goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b
              GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying
              out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our
              products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which
              processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax
              obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the
              processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the
              data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a
              visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other
              vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third
              party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally,
              processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is
              used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned
              legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
              pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden
              by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require
              protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible
              because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He
              considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client
              of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our
              legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our
              employees and the shareholders.

                My country / industry has laws requiring data privacy and security. Can I use your
                products and services and still comply with these laws?

            </p>

            <p>
              Our services are controlled, operated and administered by Us from our offices in EU.
              If you access our Products and services from outside of EU, you are responsible for
              compliance with all local laws.

              <strong>Does the Privacy Policy relate to all countries?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Yes, Our Privacy Policy is applicable worldwide.</p>

            <p>
              <strong>What happens if I violate this Privacy Policy?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              If you violate this Privacy Policy in any way or if you in any way misuse our
              webpages, misuse our Products and Services, make inappropriate user posts or violate
              any Third party rights, applicable laws, rules or regulations, you are to indemnify
              Us, our partners, officers, agents and others related to Us.
            </p>

            <h5>Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement</h5>

            <p>
              We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax
              regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the
              contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the
              data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by
              us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when
              our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data
              would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be
              concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must
              contact our Data Protection Officer.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the
              personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the
              contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the
              consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
